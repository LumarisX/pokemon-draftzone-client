          Thank you everyone for this first round of feedback and bug reporting.
          While there are still some bugs to be fixed, the major ones have been
          squashed at this point. I also got the Score button working so you can
          add the score, replay, pastes, and Pok√©mon statistics to each match.
          While there's no way to view kill leaderboards right now, I plan on
          adding it in the near future. Keep the feedback coming and thanks for
          a great first weekend!
