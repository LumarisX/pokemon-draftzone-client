          Happy April Fools' Day! Significant effort has been invested in
          enhancing stability and addressing bugs on the backend. Now, you have
          the ability to import Pokémon from your clipboard for new drafts and
          teams. The draft planner is nearing completion and is scheduled for
          release in the coming weeks. Thanks everyone for the continued
          support!

          Got a couple of updates to share this week. Firstly, the mobile
          experience should be significantly improved. I've revamped the layouts
          to ensure nothing gets cut off when using a mobile device. Secondly,
          there's an update with the speedchart. You can now filter speed by
          modifiers. Simply look for the icon in the top right corner to adjust
          the visible speed modifiers as needed.

          Thank you everyone for this first round of feedback and bug reporting.
          While there are still some bugs to be fixed, the major ones have been
          squashed at this point. I also got the Score button working so you can
          add the score, replay, pastes, and Pokémon statistics to each match.
          While there's no way to view kill leaderboards right now, I plan on
          adding it in the near future. Keep the feedback coming and thanks for
          a great first weekend!
