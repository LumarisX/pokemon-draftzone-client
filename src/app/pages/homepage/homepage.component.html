                >Draft Planner</a
              >! You can now plan out your drafts by viewing the details of your
              team quickly and easily. Swap pokemon to immediately see how your
              team changes to create the best draft. There are many additional
              features that I have planned for it in the future, including
              charts, recommended picks, and custom filters, that will be
              implemented in the next few weeks. Please let me know of any bug
              or issues that you experience when using it.

              Happy April Fools' Day! Significant effort has been invested in
              enhancing stability and addressing bugs on the backend. Now, you
              have the ability to import Pokémon from your clipboard for new
              drafts and teams. The draft planner is nearing completion and is
              scheduled for release in the coming weeks. Thanks everyone for the
              continued support!

              Got a couple of updates to share this week. Firstly, the mobile
              experience should be significantly improved. I've revamped the
              layouts to ensure nothing gets cut off when using a mobile device.
              Secondly, there's an update with the speedchart. You can now
              filter speed by modifiers. Simply look for the icon in the top
              right corner to adjust the visible speed modifiers as needed.

              Thank you everyone for this first round of feedback and bug
              reporting. While there are still some bugs to be fixed, the major
              ones have been squashed at this point. I also got the Score button
              working so you can add the score, replay, pastes, and Pokémon
              statistics to each match. While there's no way to view kill
              leaderboards right now, I plan on adding it in the near future.
              Keep the feedback coming and thanks for a great first weekend!
